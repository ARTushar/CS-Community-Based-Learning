<h2>
    <a name="assertion_python">Assertions in Python</a>
</h2>
<p>
    An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you
    are done with your testing of the program.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a
            raise-ifstatement (or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not
            statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up
            false, an exception is raised.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest
            keyword to Python, introduced in version 1.5.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to
            check for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid
            output.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    The assert Statement
</h3>
<p>
    When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying
    expression, which is hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python
    raises an <em>AssertionError</em> exception.
</p>
<p>
    The syntax for assert is −
</p>
<pre>assert Expression[, Arguments]
</pre>
<p>
    If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for
    the AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled
    like any other exception, using the try-except statement. If they are not
    handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback.
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    Here is a function that converts a given temperature from degrees Kelvin to
    degrees Fahrenheit. Since 0° K is as cold as it gets, the function bails
    out if it sees a negative temperature −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3
def KelvinToFahrenheit(Temperature):
   assert (Temperature &gt;= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
   return ((Temperature-273)*1.8)+32

print (KelvinToFahrenheit(273))
print (int(KelvinToFahrenheit(505.78)))
print (KelvinToFahrenheit(-5))</pre>
<p>
    When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
</p>
<pre>32.0
451
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
print KelvinToFahrenheit(-5)
File "test.py", line 4, in KelvinToFahrenheit
assert (Temperature &gt;= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
AssertionError: Colder than absolute zero!
</pre>
<h2>
    What is Exception?
</h2>
<p>
    An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program
    that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general,
    when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it
    raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an
    error.
</p>
<p>
    When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the
    exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.
</p>
<h2>
    Handling an exception
</h2>
<p>
    If you have some <em>suspicious</em> code that may raise an exception, you
    can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a try: block.
    After the try: block, include an except: statement, followed by a block of
    code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<p>
    Here is simple syntax of <em>try....except...else</em> blocks −
</p>
<pre>try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except ExceptionI:
   If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.
except ExceptionII:
   If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. </pre>
<p>
    Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax −
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is
            useful when the try block contains statements that may throw
            different types of exceptions.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any
            exception.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The
            code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does
            not raise an exception.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try:
            block's protection.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    This example opens a file, writes content in the, file and comes out
    gracefully because there is no problem at all −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
except IOError:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
else:
   print ("Written content in the file successfully")
   fh.close()</pre>
<p>
    This produces the following result −
</p>
<pre>Written content in the file successfully
</pre>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    This example tries to open a file where you do not have the write
    permission, so it raises an exception −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "r")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
except IOError:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
else:
   print ("Written content in the file successfully")</pre>
<p>
    This produces the following result −
</p>
<pre>Error: can't find file or read data
</pre>
<h2>
    The except Clause with No Exceptions
</h2>
<p>
    You can also use the except statement with no exceptions defined as follows
    −
</p>
<pre>try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except:
   If there is any exception, then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. </pre>
<p>
    This kind of a try-except statement catches all the exceptions that occur.
    Using this kind of try-except statement is not considered a good
    programming practice though, because it catches all exceptions but does not
    make the programmer identify the root cause of the problem that may occur.
</p>
<h2>
    The except Clause with Multiple Exceptions
</h2>
<p>
    You can also use the same <em>except</em> statement to handle multiple
    exceptions as follows −
</p>
<pre>try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except(Exception1[, Exception2[,...ExceptionN]]]):
   If there is any exception from the given exception list, 
   then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. </pre>
<h2>
    The try-finally Clause
</h2>
<p>
    You can use a finally: block along with a try: block. The finally: block is
    a place to put any code that must execute, whether the try-block raised an
    exception or not. The syntax of the try-finally statement is this −
</p>
<pre>try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
   Due to any exception, this may be skipped.
finally:
   This would always be executed.
   ......................</pre>
<p>
    Note − You can provide except clause(s), or a finally clause, but not both.
    You cannot use <em>else</em> clause as well along with a finally clause.
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
finally:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
   fh.close()</pre>
<p>
    If you do not have permission to open the file in writing mode, then this
    will produce the following result −
</p>
<pre>Error: can't find file or read data
</pre>
<p>
    Same example can be written more cleanly as follows −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   try:
      fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
   finally:
      print ("Going to close the file")
      fh.close()
except IOError:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")</pre>
<p>
    When an exception is thrown in the <em>try</em> block, the execution
    immediately passes to the <em>finally</em> block. After all the statements
    in the <em>finally</em> block are executed, the exception is raised again
    and is handled in the <em>except</em>statements if present in the next
    higher layer of the <em>try-except</em> statement.
</p>
<h2>
    Argument of an Exception
</h2>
<p>
    An exception can have an <em>argument</em>, which is a value that gives
    additional information about the problem. The contents of the argument vary
    by exception. You capture an exception's argument by supplying a variable
    in the except clause as follows −
</p>
<pre>try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except ExceptionType as Argument:
   You can print value of Argument here...</pre>
<p>
    If you write the code to handle a single exception, you can have a variable
    follow the name of the exception in the except statement. If you are
    trapping multiple exceptions, you can have a variable follow the tuple of
    the exception.
</p>
<p>
    This variable receives the value of the exception mostly containing the
    cause of the exception. The variable can receive a single value or multiple
    values in the form of a tuple. This tuple usually contains the error
    string, the error number, and an error location.
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    Following is an example for a single exception −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

# Define a function here.
def temp_convert(var):
   try:
      return int(var)
   except ValueError as Argument:
      print ("The argument does not contain numbers\n", Argument)

# Call above function here.
temp_convert("xyz")</pre>
<p>
    This produces the following result −
</p>
<pre>The argument does not contain numbers
invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'xyz'
</pre>
<h2>
    Raising an Exception
</h2>
<p>
    You can raise exceptions in several ways by using the raise statement. The
    general syntax for the raise statement is as follows −
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]</pre>
<p>
    Here, <em>Exception</em> is the type of exception (for example, NameError)
    and <em>argument</em> is a value for the exception argument. The argument
    is optional; if not supplied, the exception argument is None.
</p>
<p>
    The final argument, traceback, is also optional (and rarely used in
    practice), and if present, is the traceback object used for the exception.
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    An exception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the exceptions
    that the Python core raises are classes, with an argument that is an
    instance of the class. Defining new exceptions is quite easy and can be
    done as follows −
</p>
<pre>def functionName( level ):
   if level &lt;1:
      raise Exception(level)
      # The code below to this would not be executed
      # if we raise the exception
   return level</pre>
<p>
    Note − In order to catch an exception, an "except" clause must refer to the
    same exception thrown either as a class object or a simple string. For
    example, to capture the above exception, we must write the except clause as
    follows −
</p>
<pre>try:
   Business Logic here...
except Exception as e:
   Exception handling here using e.args...
else:
   Rest of the code here...</pre>
<p>
    The following example illustrates the use of raising an exception −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3
def functionName( level ):
   if level &lt;1:
      raise Exception(level)
      # The code below to this would not be executed
      # if we raise the exception
   return level

try:
   l = functionName(-10)
   print ("level = ",l)
except Exception as e:
   print ("error in level argument",e.args[0])</pre>
<p>
    This will produce the following result
</p>
<pre>error in level argument -10
</pre>
<h2>
    User-Defined Exceptions
</h2>
<p>
    Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes
    from the standard built-in exceptions.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example related to <em>RuntimeError</em>. Here, a class is
    created that is subclassed from <em>RuntimeError</em>. This is useful when
    you need to display more specific information when an exception is caught.
</p>
<p>
    In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the
except block. The variable e is used to create an instance of the class    <em>Networkerror</em>.
</p>
<pre>class Networkerror(RuntimeError):
   def __init__(self, arg):
      self.args = arg</pre>
<p>
    So once you have defined the above class, you can raise the exception as
    follows −
</p>
<pre>try:
   raise Networkerror("Bad hostname")
except Networkerror,e:
   print e.args</pre>
