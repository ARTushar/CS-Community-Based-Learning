<p>
    This chapter covers all the basic I/O functions available in Python 3. For
    more functions, please refer to the standard Python documentation.
</p>
<h2>
    Printing to the Screen
</h2>
<p>
    The simplest way to produce output is using the <em>print</em> statement
    where you can pass zero or more expressions separated by commas. This
    function converts the expressions you pass into a string and writes the
    result to standard output as follows −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

print ("Python is really a great language,", "isn't it?")</pre>
<p>
    This produces the following result on your standard screen −
</p>
<pre>Python is really a great language, isn't it?
</pre>
<h2>
    Reading Keyboard Input
</h2>
<p>
    Python 2 has two built-in functions to read data from standard input, which
    by default comes from the keyboard. These functions are input() and
    raw_input()
</p>
<p>
    In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Moreover, input()
    functions read data from keyboard as string, irrespective of whether it is
    enclosed with quotes ('' or "" ) or not.
</p>
<h2>
    The input Function
</h2>
<p>
    The input([prompt]) function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it
    assumes that the input is a valid Python expression and returns the
    evaluated result to you.
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input("something:")
something:10

&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'10'

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string with or without ''

&gt;&gt;&gt; x
"'10'"</pre>
<h2>
    Opening and Closing Files
</h2>
<p>
    Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and
    output. Now, we will see how to use actual data files.
</p>
<p>
    Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files
    by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a file object.
</p>
<h2>
    The open Function
</h2>
<p>
    Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's
    built-in open() function. This function creates a file object, which would
    be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])
</pre>
<p>
    Here are parameter details −
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            file_name − The file_name argument is a string value that contains
            the name of the file that you want to access.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            access_mode − The access_mode determines the mode in which the file
            has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. A complete list
            of possible values is given below in the table. This is an optional
            parameter and the default file access mode is read (r).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            buffering − If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes
            place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed
            while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an
            integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the
            indicated buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system
            default(default behavior).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Here is a list of the different modes of opening a file −

<h2>
    The file Object Attributes

</table>
<p>
    Note − softspace attribute is not supported in Python 3.x
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
print ("Name of the file: ", fo.name)
print ("Closed or not : ", fo.closed)
print ("Opening mode : ", fo.mode)
fo.close()</pre>
<p>
    This produces the following result −
</p>
<pre>Name of the file:  foo.txt
Closed or not :  False
Opening mode :  wb
</pre>
<h2>
    The close() Method
</h2>
<p>
    The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and
    closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.
</p>
<p>
    Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is
    reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method
    to close a file.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>fileObject.close();</pre>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
print ("Name of the file: ", fo.name)

# Close opened file
fo.close()</pre>
<p>
    This produces the following result −
</p>
<pre>Name of the file:  foo.txt
</pre>
<h2>
    Reading and Writing Files
</h2>
<p>
    The file object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier.
    We would see how to use read() and write() methods to read and write files.
</p>
<h2>
    The write() Method
</h2>
<p>
    The write() method writes any string to an open file. It is important to
    note that Python strings can have binary data and not just text.
</p>
<p>
    The write() method does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of
    the string −
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>fileObject.write(string);
</pre>
<p>
    Here, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened file.
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "w")
fo.write( "Python is a great language.\nYeah its great!!\n")

# Close opend file
fo.close()</pre>
<p>
    The above method would create foo.txt file and would write given content in
    that file and finally it would close that file. If you would open this
    file, it would have the following content −
</p>
<pre>Python is a great language.
Yeah its great!!
</pre>
<h2>
    The read() Method
</h2>
<p>
    The read() method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note
    that Python strings can have binary data. apart from text data.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>fileObject.read([count]);
</pre>
<p>
    Here, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened
file. This method starts reading from the beginning of the file and if    <em>count</em> is missing, then it tries to read as much as possible, maybe
    until the end of file.
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    Let us take a file <em>foo.txt</em>, which we created above.
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Read String is : ", str)

# Close opened file
fo.close()</pre>
<p>
    This produces the following result −
</p>
<pre>Read String is :  Python is
</pre>
<h2>
    File Positions
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>tell()</em> method tells you the current position within the file;
    in other words, the next read or write will occur at that many bytes from
    the beginning of the file.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>seek(offset[, from])</em> method changes the current file position.
    The offsetargument indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The from
    argument specifies the reference position from where the bytes are to be
    moved.
</p>
<p>
    If <em>from</em> is set to 0, the beginning of the file is used as the
    reference position. If it is set to 1, the current position is used as the
    reference position. If it is set to 2 then the end of the file would be
    taken as the reference position.
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    Let us take a file <em>foo.txt</em>, which we created above.
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Read String is : ", str)

# Check current position
position = fo.tell()
print ("Current file position : ", position)

# Reposition pointer at the beginning once again
position = fo.seek(0, 0)
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Again read String is : ", str)

# Close opened file
fo.close()</pre>
<p>
    This produces the following result −
</p>
<pre>Read String is :  Python is
Current file position :  10
Again read String is :  Python is
</pre>
<h2>
    Renaming and Deleting Files
</h2>
<p>
    Python os module provides methods that help you perform file-processing
    operations, such as renaming and deleting files.
</p>
<p>
    To use this module, you need to import it first and then you can call any
    related functions.
</p>
<h2>
    The rename() Method
</h2>
<p>
    The rename() method takes two arguments, the current filename and the new
    filename.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>

<h2>
    Directories in Python
</h2>
<p>
    All files are contained within various directories, and Python has no
    problem handling these too. The os module has several methods that help you
    create, remove, and change directories.
</p>
<h2>
    The mkdir() Method
</h2>
<p>
    You can use the mkdir() method of the os module to create directories in
    the current directory. You need to supply an argument to this method, which
    contains the name of the directory to be created.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>os.mkdir("newdir")
</pre>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    Following is an example to create a directory <em>test</em> in the current
    directory −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Create a directory "test"
os.mkdir("test")</pre>
<h2>
    The chdir() Method
</h2>
<p>
    You can use the <em>chdir()</em> method to change the current directory.
    The chdir() method takes an argument, which is the name of the directory
    that you want to make the current directory.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>os.chdir("newdir")
</pre>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    Following is an example to go into "/home/newdir" directory −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Changing a directory to "/home/newdir"
os.chdir("/home/newdir")</pre>
<h2>
    The getcwd() Method
</h2>
<p>
    The getcwd() method displays the current working directory.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>os.getcwd()</pre>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    Following is an example to give current directory −
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# This would give location of the current directory
os.getcwd()</pre>
<h2>
    The rmdir() Method
</h2>
<p>
    The rmdir() method deletes the directory, which is passed as an argument in
    the method.
</p>
<p>
    Before removing a directory, all the contents in it should be removed.
</p>
<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>
<pre>os.rmdir('dirname')
</pre>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    Following is an example to remove the "/tmp/test" directory. It is required
    to give fully qualified name of the directory, otherwise it would search
    for that directory in the current directory.
</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# This would  remove "/tmp/test"  directory.
os.rmdir( "/tmp/test"  )</pre>

    File and Directory Related Methods
</h2>
<p>
    There are three important sources, which provide a wide range of utility
    methods to handle and manipulate files &amp; directories on Windows and
    Unix operating systems. They are as follows −
